# oUF P3lim

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It can be downloaded at [Curse](http://curse.com/addons/wow/ouf-p3lim) or at [WoWInterface](http://wowinterface.com/downloads/info8455).

## Description

oUF P3lim is a layout made for the unitframe framework oUF.  
It is a personal layout, customized to my every need, and because of this I am not taking any feature requests.  
I've written this layout to be easily readable for those who would like to use it as a reference to their own layout(s).  
If you intend to use this layout or parts of it, please credit me for my work.

It has the following features:

- Minimalistic layout.
- Supports most roles and playstyles, although designed around damage/tanking.
- Completely stand-alone, oUF is embedded.
- [oUF Experience](https://github.com/p3lim-wow/oUF_Experience/wiki) is embedded.
- [oUF MovableFrames](https://github.com/haste/oUF_MovableFrames) is embedded (type `/pmf` to move).

The following units are supported:

- Player
- Target
- TargetTarget
- Focus
- Party/Raid
- Pet (health value on player frame)
- Boss
- Arena (including preparation)

The following class-specific powers are supported:

- Death Knight's Runes
